# raspberryPiOTA
Lightweight Python OTA update system for Raspberry Pi using GSM modules and cellular data. Ideal for remote IoT deployments — checks for new code, downloads updates, and restarts automatically. No third-party services required.

# Python OTA Updater for Raspberry Pi (GSM/Cellular-Based)

This project provides a simple Over-the-Air (OTA) update mechanism for Python scripts running on a Raspberry Pi (or any small PC) using GSM modules and cellular data. It checks for new code from your own server, downloads updates when available, replaces the current script, and restarts the application automatically.

## 📦 Features

- 🔁 Auto-check for updates on start
- ☁️ Downloads new code from a remote server
- ⚡ Replaces the current script with the updated one
- 🚀 Auto-restarts after a successful update
- 🧱 Lightweight and dependency-free
- 📡 Works over 3G/4G GSM connections (SIM800/SIM7600/etc.)
